				<p><strong>Here's how it works!</strong> You buy a ticket and your name gets entered in a draw for loot. As certain numbers of tickets are purchased, a loot tier is unlocked. All people who have already bought tickets get a chance to win. If you do win, you collect your prize and your name is removed from the draw.
The more pre-event tickets we sell, the more tiers we unlock and the more prizes you can win! We've teamed up with local hobby shops, gaming stores, and many more spots to make each tier even more juicy than the last.</p>
